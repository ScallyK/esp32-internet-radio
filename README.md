# esp32-internet-radio
I created an internet radio using an esp32, an VS1053 MP3 decoder, a ST7735 TFT display, and a PAM8403 amplifier. During the process, I had a difficult time locating drivers for all the modules I used, as well as finding sources for radio streams. I put together a GitHub repo to act as a one stop for others embarking on similar projects.
